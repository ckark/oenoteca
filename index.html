	<h2 class="white">SO, WHAT'S OENOTECA?</h2>
	<p class="white">Oenoteca is a wine distribution service that dispenses sustainably-grown wines directly from the cask. Serving wine on tap eliminates bottles from the supply chain, reducing the cost and carbon footprint of enjoying wine. Save your business up to 25% of the standard price of selling wine.</p>
</section>
<section class="container-product2">
	<h2>WHY THE CASK?</h2>
	<p>Walk into the nearest grocer or liquor store and you’ll see hundreds, even thousands of bottles of wine lining the shelves.
<br><br>
Of those, upwards of 10% will be “corked,” spoiled by compounds in the cork that contaminate the wine. Those that aren’t corked can’t sit around for long once opened. If cork taint doesn’t spoil wine, plain old air will. It doesn’t need to be this way.

	<h4 class="white">By serving high-quality wines directly from the cask, Oenoteca removes oxidation and cork taint from the equation.</h4>
	<p class="white">Each cask contains a stainless steel keg that dispenses wine with a nitrogen charge, ensuring freshness to the last drop.
<br><br>
Casks also come equipped with small monitors that display temperature, internal pressure, and the amount remaining. Rather than selling wine by the bottle, customers can bring their own or buy empty bottles. It’s like buying beer by the growler, except with wine.

	<h2 class="white">HOW IT WORKS</h2>
	<div class="step-box">
		<img src="assets/step1.png"/>
	</div>
	<div class="description">
		<h4 class="white">Oenoteca stocks over 1,000 wines from vintners around the world.</h4>
		<p class="white">If your customers buy a certain variety of wine en masse—a full-bodied red blend, for example—you’ll save thousands of dollars each year by selling it from a cask. Whatever you’re looking for, Oenoteca probably has it. We offer three sizes of cask: a small format of 19.5 liters (~5.15 gallons), a medium format of  29.33 liters (~7.75 gallons), and a large format of 58.7 liters (~15.5 gallons).
</p>
	</div>
	<div class="step-box">
		<img src="assets/step2.png"/>
	</div>
	<div class="description">
		<h4 class="white">Once filled, casks ship within 48 hour of placing your order.</h4>
		<p class="white">The price of shipping ranges from $6 to $10 per cask, depending on distance. A cask weighs less and occupies less space than a case of wine bottles, a safeguard against breakage in transit. Strong yet lightweight, Oenoteca’s casks contain more of the wine your customers enjoy for a fraction of the price and none of the risk.
</p>

	</div>
	<div class="description">
		<h4 class="white">Oenoteca casks come standard with a tap and portable dispensing stand.</h4>
		<p class="white">Once set up, the cask is ready for customers to fill with their own empty bottles or ones you sell. We recommend selling each bottle filled from the cask at a slight discount. You’ll spark interest and incentivize customers to save money and reduce their carbon footprint.
</p>

	</div>
	<div class="description">
		<h4 class="white">Return one, get another during the same delivery.</h4>
		<p class="white">Cleaning up is no fun, especially when you have wine to sell. Leave it to us to pick up and clean empty casks. We make things easier by delivering filled casks when picking up empty ones. That way, your wine supply will never run dry.</p>

	<h2>AREN'T CASKS MORE EXPENSIVE?</h2>
	<p>Buying wine by the cask saves a lot of money—around 25% compared to an equivalent amount of wine sold in bottles. But did you know it also saves the environment?

	<div class="impact-header-left"><h3 class="white">CARBON FOOTPRINT</h4></div>
	<div class="impact-header-right"><h3 class="white">REUSABLE CASKS</h4></div>
	<div class="impact-img-left"><img src="assets/globe.png"></div>
<div class="impact-img-right"><img src="assets/recycle.png"></div>
<div class="impact-description-left"><p class="white">Producing a single bottle of wine expends as much CO2 as driving three miles in a mid-sized sedan. Shipping it by truck from Napa Valley to San Francisco emits 2.6 pounds of carbon dioxide.
<br><br>
By plane to New York, its CO emissions skyrocket to over 20 pounds. A small (19.5 l.) cask, by contrast, saves the equivalent amount of carbon dioxide as taking a car off the road for two years. A medium (29.33 l.) cask extends that time to three years and a large (58.7 l). cask to six. </p></div>
<div class="impact-description-right"><p class="white">As receptacles go, bottles are about as inefficient as they come. If vintners reduced the weight of bottles by 40%, or use an alternative packaging of equivalent weight, they’d save around 234g of CO2 per bottle.
<br><br>
Substituting casks for bottles can reduce your carbon footprint up to 96% over 20 years—no small figure, considering the 600 million bottles uncorked each year. Of those, only one in five is recycled; the rest wind up in landfills, each taking around a million years to decompose.

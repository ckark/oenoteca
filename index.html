                        <br>
                        <p class="white">Oenoteca is a wine distribution service that dispenses sustainably-grown wines
                        directly from the cask. Serving wine on tap eliminates bottles from the supply chain, reducing
                        the cost and carbon footprint of enjoying wine. Save your business up to <strong>25% of the
                        standard price</strong> of selling wine.</p>

                        <h3>WHY THE CASK?</h3><br>
                        <br>
                        <p>Walk into the nearest grocer or liquor store and you’ll see hundreds, even thousands of
                        bottles of wine lining the shelves.<br>
                        <br>
                        Of those, upwards of 10% will be “corked,” spoiled by compounds in the cork that contaminate
                        the wine. Those that aren’t corked can’t sit around for long once opened. If cork taint doesn’t
                        spoil wine, plain old air will. It doesn’t need to be this way.</p>

                        <p class="white">Each cask contains a stainless steel keg that dispenses wine with a nitrogen

                        <br>
                        Casks also come equipped with small monitors that display temperature, internal pressure, and
                        the amount remaining. Rather than selling wine by the bottle, customers can bring their own or
                        buy empty bottles. It’s like buying beer by the growler, except with wine.</p>

                                        by selling it from a cask. Whatever you’re looking for, Oenoteca probably has

                                        space than a case of wine bottles, a safeguard against breakage in transit.
                                        Strong yet lightweight, Oenoteca’s casks contain more of the wine your
                                        customers enjoy for a fraction of the price and none of the risk.</p>

                                        filled from the cask at a slight discount. You’ll spark interest and
                                        incentivize customers to save money and reduce their carbon footprint.</p>

                                miles in a mid-sized sedan. Shipping it by truck from Napa Valley to San Francisco

                                the road for two years. A medium (29.33 l.) cask extends that time to three years and a

                                <p align="left">I grew up near vineyards outside of Naples, Italy, and moved to the
                                United States for graduate school. My parents are winemakers who lease casks directly
                                to restauranteurs and grocers, who sell wine on tap. Family and friends came to fill
                                their bottles with some of the best wine in Campagna. Now that I produce organic wines
                                in drought-ridden California, I’m concerned about costs and my carbon footprint.
                                Oenoteca’s casks address both concerns head on, saving me thousands of dollars per year
                                while minimizing my impact on the environment.</p><br>

                                <p align="left" class="white">Operating a small restaurant forces you to get creative
                                about space. Back in the Basque Country, where I learned about cooking and wine, the
                                best restaurants contained vast underground cellars that held some of the finest wines
                                to be had. New York, as every budding restauranteur knows, offers little room and lots
                                of expectations. Then I remembered that some taverns in Spain serve their wine from
                                large barrels to save themselves the hassle of stocking bottles. A bit of research took
                                me to Oenoteca, now my informal “wine cellar.” Ten-medium size casks are all we need to
                                operate for a month, around half the price needed for the same amount of wine in
                                bottles.</p><br>
